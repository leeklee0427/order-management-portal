## Description

The Order Management Portal Database is a comprehensive system designed to streamline the management of retail operations. This database serves as a central hub for both customers and store managers, facilitating efficient handling of various key aspects related to retail store management.

The use of this database significantly reduces manual effort and minimizes errors in managing retail operations. By automating various processes like inventory tracking, order processing, and customer management, the system enhances efficiency and productivity.
